#### Business Objective
Google Merchandise Store (GStore) aims to increase its revenue by gaining a better understanding of its customers and making appropriate investments in the
promotional strategies. In the sphere of commerce, Pareto Principle dictates that “80 percent of
your profits come from 20 percent of your customers” and holds true for many businesses. To
improve its revenue, GStore should figure out
where the top buyers converge – the demographic region they fall in, the traffic channels they
came from, the ads/campaigns on which they converted and the promotional content that they
engaged. On
the other side of the spectrum, GStore should also segment customers and identify patterns and commonalities among
dissatisfied customers that made fewer purchases. 

#### Role of Analytics
We used two analytical approaches to address these business problems. First, we used user-level
descriptive RFM (Recency, Frequency and Monetary) analysis to segment customers and give
corresponding recommendations. Then, on the transaction level, we used predictive models like
random forest to find the most important features that contributed to the revenue and then did
further descriptive analysis on the traffic-to-sales conversion rate to see which sections within each
of them have the most potential to generate more revenue.
